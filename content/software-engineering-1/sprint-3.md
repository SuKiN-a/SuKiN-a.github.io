This sprint was closer to being a sprint and a half. All of the team had other obligations, so we had to extend it to almost two weeks. We faced significant burnout among certain members, so the velocity also ground to a halt.

# My Contribution and Commitment to the Project

I implemented the backend team creation, event creation, team joining, and event joining functionality[^1]. I also wrote API wrappers for the aforementioned functionality[^2]. I also implemented a few hotfixes[^4]. I think I got a fair bit of work done, even if a lot of the functionality wasn't exposed to the UI due to frontend issues.

# Tracking and Self-Improvement

I kept using codetime for tracking. The time spent aside from coding was around 9 hours. I don't really have a lot of comments for my time spent this sprint.

# Reflection and Self-Directed Learning

This sprint was a mixed bag, while I did implement all my assigned tasks fast, our decisions from the start held us back significantly. If we were to have done this again, I'm confident that we'd have implemented all of the functionality in the UI much earlier.

# Management of Individual Tasks

This week was mostly SCRUM compliant, however we extended the duration of the sprint multiple times and was completely bottlenecked by a single member for most of it. Our processes aside from this was reasonable correct, the backlog allocation was done very well and the tasks were well described.

# Communication

We had a total of 5 meetings[^3] during this sprint, and a one-on-one meeting with a member[^5]. Semi regular discord status updates were also present.

[^5]: discord doesn't seem to have messages of meetings done in servers, so this is the only evidence i could dig up ![meeting](../hamad-meeting.png)
