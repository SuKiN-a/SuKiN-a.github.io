# Ismayilzada Hamza

## Overall effort for the project work (0-5 + explanation)?

4/5. He fulfilled his role reasonably well, however, the tiny scope led to him not having a lot of tasks to do.

## Success of role based tasks?

It was *okay*, the role of end user tester was mostly filled.

# Ullah Hamad

## Overall effort for the project work (0-5 + explanation)?

5/5. He spent an inordinate amount of time on the project.

## Fitting to role?

He was okay, the UI was decently implemented, but needed a bit too much involvement from the rets of the team.

It was okay, the work done was disproportionately slow, and the code was shoddy at best, but it worked and it was a learning experience for him.

He was confident and fast(ish) at implementing the UI, but his JS was quite bad and half broken at times.
