# My Contribution and Commitment to the Project

As this was the first sprint, we started with the basics[^1][^2]: deciding on the roles, scheduling, project requirements and the like. I volunteered to be a developer, although I specialized into the role of backend developer later. During the first sprint I set up the project and implemented user signup[^3], login[^4] and authentication[^4]. We did have plans for email verification, but it was shelved due to time constraints.


# Tracking and Self-Improvement

I primarily tracked my time using wakatime(a vscode extension that tracks time spent) and manually logged my time spent on research and other tasks, as I found using a hosted solution to be invasive and not very well suited to my work patterns which involve short bursts intermixed with longer sessions. This sprint's time data is in text because wakatime only supports history of 2 weeks. I switched to another service in the following weeks due to this.

```
8-4-2024: 1 hour 2 minutes
9-4-2024: 5 hours 49 minutes
10-4-2024: 12 minutes
11-4-2024: 3 minutes
```
