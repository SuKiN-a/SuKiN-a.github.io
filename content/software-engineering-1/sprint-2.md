# My Contribution and Commitment to the Project

This sprint was *okay*. There were a number of confounding factors(an exam, huge bottlenecks in the division of labour and planning on my part) which led to my contributions this week being relegated to tasks such as deploying the app[^1] and general improvements[^2] to the process.

# Tracking and Self-Improvement

I kept track of coding time using codetime this sprint due to the limitations of the wakatime extension I was using. The time spent aside from coding was around 8 hours.

# Reflection and Self-Directed Learning

This week went mostly fine, the project needed a week to get everything set up and we needed some features to land last sprint to get the team motivated to work. I did still suffer from terrible communication, since I didn't step in to try to fix any of the issues we faced, but it wasn't anything too bad.


# Management of Individual Tasks

This week had me doing quite a bit of work that wasn't included in the backlog. This was totally my own fault for not remembering to discuss those tasks in the meetings, but I would say that this wasn't a great SCRUM setup for me. However, the rest of the team were wonderful and followed the process to a T.


# Communication

I had a meeting[^3] with a teammate on writing tests for the project, alongside the standard 2 meetings[^4][^5] a week and frequent status updates.
