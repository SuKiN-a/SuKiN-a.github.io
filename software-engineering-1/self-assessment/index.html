            <h1 id="contribution-and-commitment-to-the-project">Contribution and Commitment to the Project</h1>
<h2 id="how-do-you-ensure-the-completion-of-your-assigned-tasks">How do you ensure the completion of your assigned tasks?</h2>
<p>Automated timing IDE extensions and manual tracking for research. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-keep-track-of-how-work-is-distributed-among-your-team-members">How do you keep track of how work is distributed among your team members?</h2>
<p>I tried to help members who seemed to be overwhelmed.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-ensure-that-you-follow-your-team-s-instructions-and-agreed-upon-plans">How do you ensure that you follow your team’s instructions and agreed-upon plans?</h2>
<p>I read through the meeting minutes and was active on the discord.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-analyze-the-relationship-between-your-individual-tasks-and-the-overall-project-goals">How do you analyze the relationship between your individual tasks and the overall project goals?</h2>
<p>I helped create the tasks which I thought would be the best at driving the project forward.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-assess-the-fairness-of-task-distribution-within-your-team">How do you assess the fairness of task distribution within your team?</h2>
<p>I kept time allocation in mind while we discussed backlog items to allocate to members.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-familiarize-yourself-with-the-activities-of-other-teams">How do you familiarize yourself with the activities of other teams?</h2>
<p>I talked to friends in other teams.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-evaluate-the-significance-of-your-specific-tasks-for-the-overall-success-of-the-project">How do you evaluate the significance of your specific tasks for the overall success of the project?</h2>
<p>My tasks due to their nature as the backend were instrumental in the success of the project. Most of the logic for the app runs on it.</p>
<h2 id="how-have-you-worked-to-promote-equitable-task-distribution-within-your-team">How have you worked to promote equitable task distribution within your team?</h2>
<p>I recommended easing the burden off of members who were overwhelmed. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-incorporate-best-practices-from-other-teams-into-your-own-team-s-activities">How do you incorporate best practices from other teams into your own team’s activities?</h2>
<p>We didn't.</p>
<h1 id="monitoring-and-self-improvement">Monitoring and Self-Improvement</h1>
<h2 id="how-do-you-keep-a-record-of-your-total-work-time-spent-on-the-project">How do you keep a record of your total work time spent on the project?</h2>
<p>I relied on autogenerated reports for that.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-track-the-time-spent-on-improvement-related-activities">How do you track the time spent on improvement-related activities?</h2>
<p>I manually tracked them.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-document-the-time-spent-on-communication">How do you document the time spent on communication?</h2>
<p>The scrum master wrote meeting minutes which included the time spent in the meeting. The time spent on voice chats were logged by discord.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-differentiate-the-time-spent-on-different-tasks">How do you differentiate the time spent on different tasks?</h2>
<p>By looking at my commit messages created during that time.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-ensure-that-your-work-time-is-systematically-distributed-throughout-the-project-duration">How do you ensure that your work time is systematically distributed throughout the project duration?</h2>
<p>I didn't. My role required a lot of work during the start to get the basic app working, however, the frontend was playing catch up for the rest of the sprints.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-assess-the-monetary-value-of-the-time-you-ve-invested">How do you assess the monetary value of the time you’ve invested?</h2>
<p>It'll probably be around a few hundred euros, however, most of the time I spent on the project was fun and so putting a monetary value to it is reductive.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-differentiate-the-time-spent-on-each-iteration">How do you differentiate the time spent on each iteration?</h2>
<p>The autogenerated time reports contain it. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-evaluate-the-monetary-value-of-your-work-time-in-each-iteration">How do you evaluate the monetary value of your work time in each iteration?</h2>
<p>It's probably around a hundred euros or so, but most of the time I spent on the project was fun and so putting a monetary value to it is reductive.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-apply-insights-from-tracking-your-work-time-to-improve-your-time-estimation-for-new-tasks-in-each-iteration">How do you apply insights from tracking your work time to improve your time estimation for new tasks in each iteration?</h2>
<p>My time tracking in the first week was a bit shoddy, however I got much better at starting stopwatches when I did research. </p>
